# Client Project Portal - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Client Project Portal implementation, detailing the architecture, technologies used, and key features.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database)
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **File Storage**: UploadThing
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Integration**: Webhooks for Pabbly and GHL

## Architecture

The application follows a modern web architecture with:

- Server-side rendering for improved SEO and performance
- API routes for webhook handling and data operations
- Role-based access control for security
- Real-time database for instant updates

## Database Schema

The database consists of the following tables:

1. **Users**: Stores user information and roles (admin, team_member, client)
2. **Clients**: Stores client information and links to GHL subaccounts
3. **Projects**: Tracks projects associated with clients
4. **Tasks**: Manages tasks within projects with Kanban-style status tracking
5. **Files**: Stores file metadata for uploaded documents and images
6. **Credentials**: Securely stores access credentials with masking
7. **Onboarding_Items**: Organizes client onboarding information by category
8. **Messages**: Facilitates communication between clients and team members
9. **Notifications**: Manages system notifications for various events

## Authentication System

The authentication system uses Clerk for secure user management:

- **Sign-in/Sign-up**: Custom pages with Clerk components
- **Role Management**: Integration with Supabase for role-based access
- **Protected Routes**: AuthGuard and RoleGuard components for route protection
- **Session Management**: Handled by Clerk with secure tokens

## Core Features

- Project status overview with visual indicators
- Next task due notification
- Recent notifications feed

### Project Management

- Kanban-style board for task tracking
- Drag-and-drop interface for status updates
- Task details with descriptions, due dates, and assignees
- Project filtering and selection

### Onboarding Process

- Categorized sections (Branding, Access Credentials, Legal, Content)
- File upload capabilities for various document types
- Form inputs for text-based information
- GHL subaccount form embedding

### Asset Management

- Secure credential storage with masked passwords
- File organization and viewing
- Categorized display of uploaded assets

### Messaging System

- Thread-based conversations organized by project
- Unread message indicators
- Real-time updates
- Integration with GHL for SMS/email notifications

### Admin Dashboard

- Client overview with status indicators
- Team member assignment interface
- Project tracking across all clients
- Round-robin PM assignment capability

## Automation and Integration

### Pabbly Integration

The system integrates with Pabbly to automate client onboarding:

1. Pabbly sends client and subaccount information via webhook
2. System creates a new client profile
3. GHL subaccount ID is linked to the client
4. Project Manager is assigned using round-robin logic
5. Default project is created
6. Notification is sent to the assigned PM

### GHL Integration

The system integrates with GHL for various automations:

1. **Onboarding Completion**: Notifications when clients complete GHL forms
2. **Task Status Updates**: Synchronization of task statuses between systems
3. **Message Handling**: Processing of messages from GHL into the portal

## Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Secure authentication with Clerk
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for all routes and features
- **Data Protection**: Masked credentials and secure storage
- **API Security**: Protected API routes with proper validation
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in protection with Next.js

## Testing Strategy

The application includes comprehensive tests:

- **Unit Tests**: For individual components and hooks
- **Integration Tests**: For database operations and API endpoints
- **Security Tests**: For authentication and authorization flows

## Deployment Process

The application is deployed to Vercel with:

- Environment variables for secure configuration
- Production database setup in Supabase
- Continuous deployment from the GitHub repository

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. **Advanced Analytics**: Dashboard for project performance metrics
2. **Time Tracking**: Integration with time tracking tools
3. **Billing Integration**: Connection to payment processing for invoicing
4. **Client Portal Customization**: White-labeling options for agencies
5. **Mobile Application**: Native mobile apps for improved mobile experience
